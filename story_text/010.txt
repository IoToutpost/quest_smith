Well, there is this amazing woman interested with you (which never ever happens) yet you have a date. You are just not that person, you act like a gentleman and stay with your date. 

This impresses your date very much and she suddenly starts to look at you very differently. 

You spend a lovely night with your date and everyone goes home. Next morning your date texts you and ask you to meet for the breakfast. 

     Say Yes   Make an excuse
